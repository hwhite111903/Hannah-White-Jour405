My own iteration of the data all together:

```{r}
RIAA_revenue <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSdHiPGcxYmcvFAPLVQZ7BvEEsjBrkA3hXCwgqjcz9w5Obu0zd-a_sV7GxfsP4sU_ucjIX6nEfOIdYx/pub?output=csv")
```
What the dataset contains:
Revenue by category from 2021 to 2024 (in millions of dollars).


Categories include:

Streaming (e.g., Paid Subscription, Ad-Supported)

Physical formats (e.g., CD, LP/EP (vinyl), Music Video, Other Physical)

Totals for streaming and physical

% Change columns show year-over-year growth or decline for each category.


Time period covered:
Four years: 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024


Key columns for analysis:
LP/EP: vinyl record sales.

CD, Music Video, Other Physical: Useful for total physical media analysis.

Total Physical Value: compare overall physical trends.

Total Streaming Revenues: Use this to contrast physical vs. digital trends.


What’s missing or needed:
Consumer behavior data (demographics, preferences) isn’t included—it’s revenue-only.

No breakdown within LP/EP (e.g., genre, age group).

Inflation adjustment if you want to analyze “real” revenue change.


Questions:
Is vinyl driving the rise in physical media overall?

Are CDs declining while vinyl rises?

How does total physical media trend compare to streaming growth?

Does the growth of vinyl mirror any dips or flattening in streaming?
